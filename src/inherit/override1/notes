no need of logic from parent
logic should come only from child, 


======> method overriding [replace the parent logic]
- Used only in inheritance
- parent and child class will have the same methodName + same method signature 
but with diff logic 


Logic will come from child class:::




Method overloading is performed within class.  =>same methodName + different method signature 
Method overriding occurs in two classes. parent class and child class  =>same methodName + same method signature 



Method overloading  example:
-----------------------------------------------
class caclculator{  
	 int add(int a,int b)
	 {return a+b;}  
	 
	 int add(int a,int b,int c)
	 {return a+b+c;}  
}

  

Method overriding example:
-----------------------------------------------
public class Service{  
	  public void process()
	  {
	  	System.out.println(" process cust info");
	  }  
}  

public class AgentService extends Service 
 {  
	    public void process()
	  	{
	  		System.out.println(" process  Agent info");
	  	}
}
