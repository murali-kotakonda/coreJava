Inheritance:
--------------------------------------------
relationship between two classes.
-> its a Is-a relation.


-> there are two types of classes.
  a)Parent class/Super class/Base class
  b)sub class/child class/derived class
    
    
Public properties and methods are inherited/available to child class from parent class.

private, static are not eligible for Inheritance.


Parent class doesnt know what are the child specific properties/methods.
Relation ship is between parent class and child class , but not betweeen the parent obj and child obj.
i.e. parent obj and child obj are independent to each other

 Ex:
 1.Parent class : Loan
 Child classes: Vehicleloan, marriageLoan, personalLoan

 2.Parent class : Account
 Child classes: CurrentAccount , LoanAccount ,CreditCardAccount
 
 3.Parent class : Card
 Child classes: CreditCard , DebitCard , VirtalCard
 
 
    
advantage: 
re-usability of instance variables and methods in multiple classes

 

Req:
---------------------------------------------------------------
Person has id,name, age
Employee has id, name, age, pan , pf
create class and create object

Without Inheritance:
----------------------------------------------------------------
public class Person {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
}



public class Employee {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
  	  String pan;
      String pf;
}




With inheritance:
---------------------------------------------------------
Person is parent
Employee is child class

How to specify  the inheritance between Person and Employee??
 public class Employee extends Person {
 }
   
public class Person {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
}
    



public class Employee extends Person {
  String pan;
  String pf;
}



Write Properties/Method in parent class and reuse for Parent class and child class.



Case#1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
public class Person {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
  
  
  pubic void m1(){
    
  }
  
}


Eligible for Inheritance:
1.id,name, age 
2. m1() 



public class Employee extends Person{// Here Employee is the Child class and Person is parent class

	String pan;
	String pfNo;

  public void m2(){
    
  }
}


How many I.V are in Person : 3  [id,name, age ]
How many I.V are in Employee : 5 [id,name, age,pan ,pfNo ]


How many METHODS are in Person : 1 [m1()]
How many METHODS are in Employee : 2 [ m1() and m2() ]
  
 Case#2:
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

public class Person {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
  
  private int count;
  
  pubLic void m1(){
    
  }
  
  private void m3(){
    
  }
  
  public static void m4(){
    
  }
}


Eligible for inheritence:
1.id,name, age 
2. m1() 


count is not eligible as it is private
m3() is not eligible as it is private
m4() is not eligible as it is static


How many I.V are in Person :   
How many I.V are in Employee :   
  
How many METHODS are in Person :   
How many METHODS are in Employee :  


Types of Inheritance:
-----------------------
1.Single
2.Multi Level
3.Hierarchial
4.Multiple Inheritance is not allowed in java
