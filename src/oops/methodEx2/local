local variable:
--------------------------
local variables are created inside method
memory is allocated in stack
memory is created when method is called
memory is deleted when method execution completes.
scope is only within method.- s [cannot access outside the method]
[ one local variable in one method is visible only till that method; and it is not visible outside the method]



instance variables:
-----------------------------
- declared inside the class
- memory is created in heap
- memory is created when object is created.
- memory is deleted when object is deleted.
- scope till obj availability.
- instance  variables are always associated with object.

    int age;
    
    public void show(){
    int x=90;
    int y =40;
    
    }

}
