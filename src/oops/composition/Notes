class Person:

       String name;
       int age;

       Address addr;
        
           
    
   

person has 3 addresses:
--------------------------

class Person:
       id,name,age,addrObj1,addrObj2,addrObj3
       # here addrObj1,addrObj2,addrObj3 are the Address obj

In future if we need to add additional properties for Address then we need to change Person and Student class.

Req#1:
create obj for Person and Student.
Set data and dispalay



Req#2:
Person has 3 addresses.
then no of i.v = 3 + 15  =>18



Re#2: provide landmark for every address.
then all classes are impacted.





Solution:
->We need seperate class for address..
-> One entity class for one Model
->Since addres is used across multiple classes , we need to create seperate class for Address,

New:
--------------
class Address:
   streetNo,city,state,country,pin

class Person:
       id,name,age,AddressObj

 class Student:
       id,firstname,lastname,branch,semno,addressObj


Object as a instance variable.

In future if we need to add additional properties for Address then we need to change only address class

=> Object as instance variable... [obj cobtaining obj ]
=> person obj contains address obj
=> Student obj contains address obj

- provide landmark for every address.
 only Address class is impacted.

- Person has 3 addresses.
then no of i.v = 3 + 3 = 6
class Person:
       id,name,age,addr1,addr2,addr3
       #addr1,addr2,addr3 are obj
