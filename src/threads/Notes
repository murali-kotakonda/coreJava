Threads:
------------------------
	  threading is used for parallel programming. 
	 [ Parallel programming means Executing multiple programs at the time]
	  
	  advantage of thread:
	  -response time is improved
	  -utilization of resources
	  
	  Thread:
	  -thread is a single unit created under the process
	  -every thread has its own line of execution
	  -every thread is independent
	  
	  Process:
	  -ex:eclipse, intellij, pycharm, skype, chrome are processes
	  -every process requires separate memory
	  -a thread is a single unit under a process
	  -every thread does not require separate memory
	  -all the threads share the same memory which is allocated for the process
	  
	  when should we use thread?
	  -----------------------------------
	  -when the tasks are independent of each other, 
	  i.e.the output of one task is not required for the another task
	  - TEST the application in multiple browsers
	  - Test multiple modules of application.
	  
	  -when the thread is created it would not start immediately, because it is decided
	  by the cpu, then it would run
	   
	  we cannot determine when the thread would start or end.
	  
	  	by default java creates main thread.
		using main thread developer will create additional threads.
		
	  thread states:
	  1. ready state -- when the developer creates the thread and adds to the cpu job list
	  2. running -- when cpu gives appointment to the thread
	  3. possible 3 states after running state
	  		a. dead state or completed state
	  		b. wait state : we don't know the time
	  		c. sleep state : we will know for how long it is going to know sleep
	  


 
 How to create a thread:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. create the thread class [ two ways of creating thread class]
2. provide run method 
	  - contain the thread activity
    - run method specifies what the thread has to do.
3. create the thread object
4. call the start method
	  -thread will be in ready state
	   - start method() - internally  calls the run method when the cpu is available.
	  
	 
	  
    create the thread class:
    ----------------------------
    1. create a class extending Thread class and provide run method
    	public class MyThread extends Thread {
			public void run() {
				System.out.println("Hi");
			}
		}

    2A.create a class implements Runnable interface and provide run method
      public class MyThread implements Runnable {
			public void run() {
			System.out.println("Hi");
			}
		}

    2B. Using anonymous inner class

      Runnable r3 = new Runnable() {
			public void run() {
				System.out.println"Hi");
			}
		};
		
    2C.Using lambda expressions: 

    	Runnable r2 = () ->{
			System.out.println("Hi");
		};

	 thread props:
	 -----------------
	 every thread has thread name and thread priority
	 
	 Get current thread name:
	 -------------------------------------
	 System.out.println(Thread.currentThread()
	 
	 
	 - How to make the thread to sleep:
	 Thread.sleep(5000); // sleeps for 5 seconds
	 
	 
	 - main thread has to wait until the other threads compltes the execution?
	 use join() funtion
	 
	 
	   1. ready state -- th.start()
	  2. running -- when cpu gives appointment to the thread, run() method is called.
	  3. possible 3 states after running state
	  		a. dead state or completed state    - run() method execution is complted 
	  		b. wait state :   th1.join() --> main thread will wait for th1 to complte
	  		c. sleep state : Thread.sleep(5000);
