Vector vs ArrayList
---------------------
->Vector is synchronized
-> AL is not syncronized

->Vector is threadsafe
-> AL is not threadsafe

->Vector can be used in multithread environment
-> AL cannot be used in multithread environment




LinkedList vs ArrayList/Vector
---------------------------
->Arraylist/Vector interally uses arrays
->LinkedList internally uses linked DataStructure , every element contain data and reference of next data.
  chain of data.
  10 -> 20-> 30-> 40
  
-> Search by position is fast for AL/Vector
-> Search by position is slow for Linkedlist , as it uses linear search 
Req: list has 500 elements ,get element at 400 position
AL/Vector : 1 search
Linkedlist : 400 searches



-> Search by content is slow for AL/Vector , as it uses linear search 
-> Search by content is slow for Linkedlist , as it uses linear search 
Req: list has 500 elements ,check if "delhi" exists  , and "delhi" is in 500 position
AL/Vector : 500 search
Linkedlist : 500 searches


->Insert in between/delete in between is slow for AL/Vector
->Insert in between/delete in between is fast for Linkedlist
list.add(5, "kumar");  // fast in Linkedlist , but slow for AL/Vector.


-> Allows duplicates for  AL/Vector
-> Allows duplicates for  LinkedList


-> AL/Vector : Can grow , but cannot decrease  size
-> LinkedList : Can grow and can decrease for LinkedList




->Memory allocated and no of elements are not same in AL/Vector.  => Leads to memory wasted.
1.add 100 elements
2.delete 60 elements
==>memory: 100
==>how many elements:  40

->Memory allocated and no of elements are same in LinkedList.
1.add 100 elements
2.delete 60 elements
==>memory: 40
==>how many element:  40
  


common disadv:
-----------------------
-> Duplicates are allowed
-> SEARCH BY CONTENT is very slow
