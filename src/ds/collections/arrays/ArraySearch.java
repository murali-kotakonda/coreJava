/**
  search by content.
  
  -> search by content  is slow in arrays, because array requires linear search.
  
  Case#1: an array has 500 elements and assume "delhi" does not exists inside the array
  search "delhi" inside the array [search by content]
 
  -How many searches will it takes?
   500 (liner search)    [for arraylist /linkedlist / vector] 
  
  Case#2: an array has 500 elements and assume "delhi" exists inside the array at 400 position.
  search "delhi" inside the array [search by content]
 
  -How many searches will it takes?
   400 (liner search)    [for arraylist /linkedlist / vector] 
    
  Case#3: an array has 500 elements 
  Get the element at 400 position [search by position]
 
  -How many searches will it takes?
   1 [ search by position is fast for vector and arraylist] 
   400 [for linked list]
  
  
 search by content.
 check if  the given element is available in the array or not.
