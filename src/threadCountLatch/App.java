/**
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} Java class to synchronize your threads’ activities.
 * <br><br>
 * Source:
 * <em>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17827022/what-is-countdown-latch-in-java-multithreading</em><br>
 *
 * Any thread, usually main thread of application, which calls
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch#await()} will wait until count reaches zero or its interrupted
 * by another thread. All other thread are required to do count down by calling
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch#countDown()} once they are completed or ready.
 * <br>
 * As soon as count reaches zero, Thread awaiting starts running. One of the
 * disadvantage of {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} is that it's
 * not reusable once the count reaches to
 * zero you can not use {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} any more.
 * <br><br>
 * Use {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} when one thread, like main
 * thread, require to wait for one or more threads to complete, before it can
 * start processing.
 * <br><br>
 * Classical example of using {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} in
 * Java is any server side core  Java application which uses services
 * architecture, where multiple services
 * are provided by multiple threads and application can not start processing
 * until all services have started successfully.
