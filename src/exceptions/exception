Exception:
-----------
Unexpected scenario/event that occurs at the run time.


what happens when there is an exception:
--------------------------
-> Prog will stop/ the flow would break.
-> customer will see the technical message instead of meaningful message.
-> affect the business 

 
Why do we have Exception?:
------------------------
->Bad coding practices
->3rd party/ server/ hardware ex: db down , server is down , file is deleted
-> Missing testing the scenario
-> edge case 


Can we avoid exception during runtime?? 
NO

exception handling:
---------------------
Exception handling is what to do when there is an exception..
To handle negative scenarios
Exception handling will be required when there is an exception...



Adv:
---------------
-> resume the application flow
-> choice for retry/ continue/ stop
->prepare meaning msg to the customer..
->write the technical messages like exception reason+ cause to the server logs


What is java role?
->Java stops the application flow..
->Java creates the exception object based on the reason
->Exception obj contains 
   a)the exception msg + 
   b)what are the class+method+
   c)line nos involved for exeption(stacktrace)

 
 
How to do exception handling:
----------------------------
Introduce three blocks
1. try block
2. catch block
3. finally block


syntax:
------------------------

try{
  <write code that has chances for exception>
}
catch(<Exception object>){
  //executed only when there is an exception
  <exception handling code>
}
finally{
  <optionl, required only when dealing with 3rd parties like db, file, web connections...>
  //executed always ...
}
