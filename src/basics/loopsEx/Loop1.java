/**
  Loops/Iteration:
  ------------------
  - execute same code multiple times but every time on different data until the 
    condition is satisfied.
  
  In Java we have 3 types of loops :
  ->for 
  ->while 
  ->do while
  


for loop requires below 3 sections:
->initialization          
->condition              
->increment/decrement
